A quick tour through the merits of pure statically typed "fancy" functional languages.

## Elm

Elm is not a fancy functional language. The Elm community makes a strong case for Elm as a language and an architecture.

- Almost zero run-time bugs. Stack overflows possible but easily avoided.
- Immutability makes code easier to reason about and debug; no worries about reference vs value equality as in React/Redux.
- Great error messages.
- Fast compiler.
- Extraordinarily _simple_ and _stable_ language that is easy to learn along with _one and only one_ UX framework amplifies concepts over language feature noise.
- Single very simple Module system (no more worries about commonjs, esnext, amd, etc.) with a single module syntax and which detects circular dependencies.
- Incredible type inference.
- Well documented and semantically versioned libraries.
- Very strong tooling close to TypeScript level.
- Improved ergonomics for functional style.
- Much smaller bundle sizes than React/Redux.
- A community interested in making functional ideas accessible.
- Structural and nominal typing provides tools for both re-use/flexibility and **encapsulation** while being many times simpler than the TypeScript type system.

## PureScript / Haskell

I haven't seen many good sales pitches for fancier functional languages like PureScript which support higher-kinded types and type classes.

- Some advocates talk about theory and abstraction mechanics while failing to show practical application which leads to a sense that it is all "just academic".
Functional abstractions simplify and normalize Api's and provide a provably correct (algebraic law abiding) foundation for Api's and application types and behaviors.
The `Abstractions` folder in this repository starts with three examples of parlour tricks for a "Wow!" factor to pique interest and to show, concretely (ironic) what is
meant by abstraction. Then the [E04Traversable](./src/Abstraction/E03Traversable.purs) module gives a glimpse into the ability of abstractions to simplify Api's and uses RxJS
as a case study.
- Some pontificate on FP in a way that suggests almost all software quality techniques from OO no longer apply. This introduces wariness that FP is unfit for the enterprise and begs
the question as to how one ought to structure their programs. HOWEVER, SOLID, encapsulation, and abstraction are every bit as applicable in FP as in OO. Furthermore, the notion that behavior
can and often should be grouped with types exists in PureScript, OCaml, F#, and Haskell communities.
  - In FP languages behavior is not _strictly_ required to be organized around its type such that discipline is required. Behavior _can_ be defined in modules other than the module which defines a type but .NET
  also appreciates the merits of _some_ extrinsic behavior (see [Extension members](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods)).
  By defining one major type per module and including core functions operating on that type in said module one can achieve nearly all of the **COHERENCE** and discoverability one would expect of an OO language.
  The smallest unit of composition in a functional language is a function while in OO languages it is often an entire class (Decorator Pattern, Adapter Pattern) and this precision in FP languages
  improves transparency and decreased **COUPLING**. ‚ö†Ô∏è Since the smallest unit in an FP language is a function it is easier for undisciplined engineers to create spaghetti in an FP language than in an OO language.
  OO is like data modeling üö≤ training wheels; helpful for novice and intermediate engineers by encouraing them to organize behavior. HOWEVER, anemic classes are not only still possible but
  are, in my experience, prevalent.
  - My conjecture is that those who suggest OO principles don't apply
    - Either only worked in academia.
    - Or have only built functional programs of a _relatively_ small size. FP removes the possibility for so many errors that engineers can afford to _defer_ enterprise
    engineering practices much longer than in imperative languages.
    - Or have only worked on functional programs that are exceedingly logic heavy, with relatively few data models, and a UX with few interaction _methods_ such as videogames, simulations,
    or compilers.
    - Or lacked a proper understanding of OO patterns. I have experience of several prominent / influential engineers that are highly critical of OO that have _NEAR ZERO_ knowledge of
    Domain Driven Design, Hexagonal Architecture, the writings of Martin Fowler and/or Robert Martin, and Design Patterns. These highly intelligent and charismatic individuals have only novice
    to intermediate level knowledge of OO, or a view of OO from 1995, and yet speak very publicly about OO's faults as if experts on the subject.
